# PartnerPortalHubSpotIntegration
Integration between Microsoft PartnerPortal and HubSpot

This ARM Template creates a Logic App that will accept a HTTP POST Request from partnerportal.azure.com when a new lead is created.
It will then create a new contact in HubSpot.

It is required to have a APIKey from your HutSpot Instance.
